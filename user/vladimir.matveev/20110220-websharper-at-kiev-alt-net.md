On 25-Feb-2011 [Anton](https://t0yv0.blogspot.com/) and I will speak on the [next meeting of Kiev ALT.NET group](https://web.archive.org/web/20120506152118mp_/http://blog.kievalt.net/post/3311287064/websharper-event)[^1] specially dedicated to WebSharper. In our talk we'll try to cover all major features of WebSharper, reveal the mysteries how F# can bring fun in web programming and make it easy, what is formlets and sitelets, how to make fantastic things like developing client-side applications without explicit JavaScript, defining markup without HTML, using safe routing without text hyperlinks and many other things yet unlisted.

See you there!
