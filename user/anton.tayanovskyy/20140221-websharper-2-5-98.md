This release brings asynchronous sitelets, brings back support for targeting .NET 4.0 - 4.5.1, and offers several bug fixes.

By popular demand, we have downgraded the WebSharper stack to work well on .NET 4.0, while also working with .NET 4.5 and 4.5.1. Both F# 3.0 and F# 3.1 are now supported.

Thanks to [@Oenotria](https://twitter.com/oenotria?lang=en), WebSharper sitelets now support fully asynchronous execution, hooking into asynchronous API as an IIS handler.
