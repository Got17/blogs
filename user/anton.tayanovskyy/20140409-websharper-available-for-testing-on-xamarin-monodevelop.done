WebSharper development gains support for Mono framework on Linux and Mac OS X, and integration with Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop. The preview add-in is available for testing at <a href="https://github.com/intellifactory/monodevelop.websharper">intellifactory/monodevelop.websharper</a>

What you get:

<ul>
  <li>Ability to develop WebSharper projects on Linux and Mac OS X</li>
  <li>A viable IDE alternative to Visual Studio for WebSharper projects</li>
</ul>

What we have done:

<ul>
  <li>Worked around a bunch of xbuild bugs by rewriting WebSharper build logic from MSBuild XML to MSBuild tasks, this seems to work reliably on both Mono/xbuild and .NET/MSBuild</li>
  <li>Created an add-in for MonoDevelop and Xamarin Studio that is able to create instances of WebSharper templates</li>
</ul>

There are some remaining issues with Web project support, especially F#/Web projects integration into the IDE, but the projects are working with <b>xsp4</b>.

In the near future, we plan to push this further and hope to fully support cross-platform development of OWIN-based Web projects in F#/WebSharper that would allow hosting performant websites directly in-process, rather than relying on ASP.NET xsp4 emulation.
