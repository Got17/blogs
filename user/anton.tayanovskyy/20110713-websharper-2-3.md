[WebSharper 2.3](https://websharper.com/) improves on the 2.2 version by using a safer deployment file layout, implementing parallel Async methods in JavaScript, adding new operators, and fixing several bugs.

The deployment file layout in WebSharper 2.2 assumed that JavaScript and binary metadata files are deployed alongside WebSharper assemblies. This caused problems, in particular when these files were not being copied correctly. WebSharper 2.3 bundles these files as embedded resources, reducing the problem to conventional .NET deployment. Debug and release versions of JavaScript are now provided, with the choice being made at runtime depending on whether ASP.NET debugging is on or off.

The F# methods `Async.Parallel` and `Async.StartChild` are now available for use on the client. The implementation uses a cooperative round-robin scheduler. Thread cooperation happens on every bind in the `Async` workflow expressions.

Constructing JavaScript object literals, getting and setting object fields in F# became easier with the addition of helper operators (#456):

```fsharp
val New<'T> : seq<string*obj> -> 'T
val ( => )  : string -> obj -> string * obj
val ( ? )   : obj -> string -> 'T
val ( ?<- ) : obj -> string -> obj -> unit
```

They make this code:

```fsharp
let window = New<obj> ["height" => 640; "width" => 480]
window?height <- window?height / 2
```

equivalent to:

```javascript
var window = {height: 640, width: 480};
window.height = window.height / 2;
```

The most important fixes include #453 that was breaking virtual folder deployments of sitelet-based applications, and multiple bugs related to metadata file handling that lead to compiler failures. The bug fixes include:

```fsharp
