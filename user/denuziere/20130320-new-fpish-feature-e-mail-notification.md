A quick blog post to signal that I have just deployed a long-requested feature on FPish: e-mail notifications.

Those of you who are registered as members of FPish groups such as [Community for F#](http://fpish.net/org/c4fs) have already been receiving alerts when new events have been created. Now, FPish can also alert you in the following cases:

 * You receive a private message;
 * Someone comments on your blog entry;
 * Someone replies to your question or to your response.

All these are individually customizable in the Options tab of your [profile page](http://fpish.net/edit-profile/).
