We just released CloudSharper 0.9.19.2 for your enjoyment. The main new feature is a dockable Browse window, allowing you to work on a web or mobile application and seeing the result directly next to your code.

You can access it by:

 * Pressing `Ctrl+Alt+B` or typing `browse` in the console to show this window.

 * Selecting "Show in Browse panel" when deploying with `Ctrl+D`.

 * Selecting "Browse" in the context menu of a file in the Solution or Files view.

By ticking the "Refresh on build" checkbox, you can make the Browse window automatically refresh when a build finishes successfully. This makes the workflow to develop a web application in F# easier than ever: edit your code, press `Ctrl+B` and see the result!
