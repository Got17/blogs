We are releasing CloudSharper alpha 0.9.11.1, a bugfix version after yesterday's bigger release. As usual, some of the fixes require you to download the latest local component.

Change log:

 * [398](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/398/show-users-login-on-website-pages): Show user's login on website pages.
 * [414](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/414/local-cloudsharper-crash-on-create): Local CloudSharper crash on create workspace on mono.
 * [417](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/417/login-and-registration-add-waiting-text): Login and registration: add waiting text
 * [416](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/416/error-executing-task-websharpertask): Error executing task WebSharperTask
 * [418](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/419/middle-clicking-a-tab-to-close-it-doesnt): Middle-clicking a tab to close it doesn't work on Firefox
 * [420](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/420/nre-when-building-xbuild-library): NullReferenceException when building `msbuild Library/Library.fsproj` on WebSharper template

Known issues and workarounds:

 * On mono, running a build on a solution (`Ctrl+B`) that contains WebSharper projects fails. We are investigating this issue; in the meantime you can directly build the project itself by typing `msbuild MyProject/MyProject.fsproj` in the console (`Ctrl+E`).

Happy coding!
