We just released version 0.9.11 of CloudSharper alpha. The main highlights are:

 * Better version compatibility management. If you are trying to use CloudSharper with a local component that is not the latest, you will see either an error or a warning, depending on whether your local component is protocol-compatible with the current CloudSharper.
 
 * A user interface for NuGet package management, accessible by right-clicking the folder of a project and selecting "Manage packages".

   Note that this only installs the package into the `/packages` folder; modifying the project file to add references, as Visual Studio does, will be added in an upcoming release.
