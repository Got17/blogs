As the version number suggests, this is only a bugfix release. The issues addressed are:

 * [#301](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/301/trying-to-start-msbuild-when-a-build-is): Trying to start MSBuild while a build was already running caused the server to crash; this is no longer the case.

 * [#302](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/302/f-interactive-init-fails-to-run): The initialization code for fsi failed to run due to mismatched FSharp.Core.dll version; this caused charting and on-the-fly WebSharper compilation to fail.

As announced yesterday, we are now focusing on providing a centralized platform experience to provide CloudSharper to a group of developers or students off a single install. Follow us on twitter [@CloudSharper](http://twitter.com/cloudsharper) for further announcements!
