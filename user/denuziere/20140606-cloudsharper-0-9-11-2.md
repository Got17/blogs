This minor release fixes several bugs and hopefully clarifies the situation regarding SSL certificates for nuget.org.

Change log:

 * [#395](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/395/creating-a-new-workspace-from-zip-flattens): Respect folder structure when creating a workspace from zip.
 * [#390](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/390/completion-also-surround-with-when-the): Completion: also surround with ```...``` when the identifier starts with a digit.
 * [#415](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/415/mozroots-import-sync): On mono, on local component startup, test the presence of the SSL certificates for `nuget.org` and, in case of failure, warn that the user should run `mozroots --import --sync`.
 * [#421](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/421/deploy-window-some-directories-are): Deploy window: better heuristic to determine what is a sitelet and what is a static HTML application.

Happy coding!
