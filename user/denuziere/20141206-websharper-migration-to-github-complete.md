When we [announced WebSharper 3.0](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fsharp-opensource/4gS-qoZ2Z1g) on Wednesday, we also mentioned that we would be migrating from BitBucket to GitHub. Well, this is now done!

[Here](https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper) is the new main repository for WebSharper. All tickets from the BitBucket tracker have also been migrated (apologies to everyone whose mailbox has been spammed by this!), and are available at [this address](https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper/issues). Finally, public extensions have been transferred too (for those that weren't already GitHub-based), and are listed under the [IntelliFactory](https://github.com/intellifactory?query=websharper) organization.

We eagerly await your suggestions, bug reports and pull requests on our new repositories!
