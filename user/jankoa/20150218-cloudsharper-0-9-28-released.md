This release fixes some issues introduced in last release, and improves tooltips and autocomplete.

 * [#589](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/589/): Pressing `.` for autocomplete fixed, also works for `(`.

 * [#587](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/587/): Autocomplete works for `.fsx` files.

 * [#591](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/591/): `Save` in `File` menu and `Ctrl+S` fixed.

Happy coding!
