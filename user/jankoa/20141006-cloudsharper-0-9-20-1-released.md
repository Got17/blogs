This release makes tooltips better, adds Go To Definition, close button on docked floating panes (Console/Interactive and Browser).

The previous local component is compatible with the current site, however Go To Definition needs the latest.

Full change log:

 * [#538](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/538/): Add editor context menu with Go To Definition.
 * [#539](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/539/): Hide code tooltips when mousing over them.
 * [#554](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/554/): X icon for both FloatingPane and corresponding docked panel.

Happy coding!
